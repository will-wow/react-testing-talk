<Notes>

Hi, C5
We write a lot of react, and are into testing.
Thus the talk.
How many people here work at a company that writes react, whether or not you do
How many have written a react component?
How many are happy with their testing strategy?

</Notes>

# React is Everywhere

<Img alt="react usage" src={reactUsage} />

<Notes>

In the 2019 Stack Overflow survey, React passed Angular for the first time.
But the fact that Angular is still hanging out, and jQuery is still dominant,
means React isn't going away any time soon, there's a long tail for these frameworks.

</Notes>

# React 101

<Notes>

One-minute intro to react if you haven't seen it

</Notes>

---

```jsx
const TodoItem = ({ todo, onChange }) => {
  const isDone = todo.done;

  return (
    <div className="todo-item">
      <input value={todo.title} onChange={onChange} />
      <button onClick={onChange(!done)}>Done</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Notes>

Competitor to Angular, Vue, or backbone or ember, or jquery

A component is a funtion that takes in data like todo item and callbacks like onChange,
and renders html, inside of JS, where you can
interpolate data and bind callbacks

There's a lot more with classes and data stores and
lifecycle methods, but this is the basics.
DOM is a function of the inputs, and React figures
out how to update the dom to look the way you want it to

Way different from jquery, where you say "hey, input, this is your value now"

## React Testing is All Over the Place

| Test Runner | Test Framework        | Test Style |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Jest        | Enzyme                | Shallow    |
| Jasmine     | React Testing Library | Render     |
| Mocha       | react-test-renderer   | Snapshot   |

</div>

<Notes>

Like we saw, react is all over the place. But react testing is _all over the place_

You've got at least three popular test runners, three testing frameworks, and three main types of test

just for unit testing. We'll walk through all of these tonight.

</Notes>

---

## Cypress.io: TestableLA Approved

<Img alt="cypress.io" src={cypressDemo} />

<Notes>

As a sidenote, the browser testing landscape is a little clearer.
TestableLA has had a couple talks about Cypress last year, including one from a cypress dev
At this point, if your backend frameworks comes with a browser testing tool, then that's probably the
way to go. But if your frontend is more standalone, then cypress is a really nice choice.

I used it on my last project, and in four months we didn't have a single flaky test failure, which is pretty wild. But this talk is focued on unit testing frameworks, so we can talk more about cypress after,
if anyone is interested.

</Notes>

---

<div style={{width: "80%", textAlign: 'center'}}>

## I used them all... together

| Test Runner | Test Framework            | Test Style   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Jest**    | **Enzyme**                | **Shallow**  |
| Jasmine     | **React Testing Library** | **Render**   |
| Mocha       | **react-test-renderer**   | **Snapshot** |

</div>

<Notes>

In a recent project, we ended up using all of these in one codebase.
I wouldn't nessecarily reccomend that. Over time we learned that all of these
tools can do all three kinds of test style, so you probably only need one.

Still it means I got the chance to compare and contrast the three and report back to you!

# Test Runners

<Flex justifyContent="space-between">

<Img src={jasmineLogo} />
<Img src={mochaLogo} />
<Img src={jestLogo} />

</Flex>

<Notes>

Three big test runners. All general purpose,
good for business logic and node

How many people have used jasmine, mocha, jest

</Notes>

---

<Flex justifyContent="space-between">

<Img src={jasmineLogo} sx={{ mb: 3 }} />
<Img src={mochaLogo} />

</Flex>

- Popular for Angular (and AngularJS)
- Popular for Node.js
- Both fine choices if you're already using them :+1:

---

<Img src={jestLogo} />

- New hotness :star-struck:
- Great Visual Studio Code integration ðŸ¤“
- Comes with change watcher and code coverage ðŸ‘€
- The standard choice for React âœ…
- Good for other JS projects too

---

# Jest: Visual Studio Code integration

<Img src={jestVsCode} />

---

# Jest: Diffing

<Img src={jestTerminal} />

---

# Jest: Code Coverage Built In

<Img src={jestCoverage} />

<Notes>

Finally, jest has code coverage built in
So when Rit asks what your code coverage is, you can answer him right away

</Notes>

---

<Invert>

# TL;DR: Choose Jest for new projects

# Don't change existing tests suites

</Invert>

<Notes>

So basically, if you're starting a new project, probably go with Jest.
If you've got an exisitng project, or everybody is used to some other runner, then there's not a big reason to switch.
For the rest of this talk I'll stick with Jest, but other than snapshots this'll all be the same in any runner.

</Notes>

---

# Test Libraries

<Notes>

Now we can get into the testing libraries, which isn't so easy of a choice. I'll go through them at a high level,
and then we'll dig in to see the differences.

</Notes>

---

# Sample app

<iframe
  src="https://todo-react-testing.surge.sh/"
  width="1000"
  height="600"
  style={{ background: "#FFFCF7" }}
/>

<Notes>

As we walk through these choices, I find it's nice to have a concerete example
Ye olde todo app, made with react and redux.

- Add, remove done
- When all are done, you get a Inbox Zero message
- That message is configurable

</Notes>

---

```jsx
<Connected(TodoContainer)>
  <TodoList>
    <Connected(UsernameInput) />
    {isAllDone && <Connected(InboxZero) />}
    <TodoItem />
    <TodoItem />
    Done Items
    <TodoItem />
    <TodoItem />
  </TodoList>
</TodoContainer>
```

<Notes>

Here's what more or less the component structure looks like
There's a TodoContainer, which is connected to the redux store
It renders a TodoList component, which renders some todo items

also a Username input and conditionally an InboxZero message, both of which are also connected to redux
We'll see why that's important for testing in a bit

</Notes>

---

# TodoList Props

```jsx
const TODO_LIST = [{id: 1, title: 'Get Milk'}, ...];
const props = {
  todoList: TODO_LIST,
  onTodoChange: jest.fn(),
  onDelete: jest.fn()
};
```

<Notes>

for all these tests we'll use this same set of props
as we saw, a component takes a set of props to render itself and return HTML
So if todo list prop has two items, then the component will render two input boxes
Also, jest.fn is how you make a spy in jest.
A spy is a function that we can make return something if we want
But either way can check if its been called in a test.

TodoList interacts with the redux store, so clicking a button won't directly do anything except call one of these functions
That means...

</Notes>

---

# Most React Tests test two things:

1. Given **props**, does it render the right **elements**?
1. Given an **event**, does it **call** the right functions?

---

# Decisions, decisions...

Shallow vs Full Render

Tradtional Expectations vs Snapshots

<Notes>

Let's go through them

</Notes>

---

# Shallow Render

```jsx
<div className="todo-list">
  <Connected(UsernameInput) />
  <TodoItem />
  <TodoItem />
  Done Items
  <TodoItem />
  <TodoItem />
</div>
```

<Notes>

In a shallow test, you only render one level deep. So if I shallow-rendered the TodoList component, it renders
its children, which are TodoItem components. But it doesn't go and render those children,
so it doesn't go all the way to the level of buttons and inputs
Makes for good unit testing - TodoList doesn't know how its children render themselves, so arguably its test shouldn't either

</Notes>

# Enzyme

| Strengh        | Shallow testing |
| Weakness       | Refactoring     |

</div>

</BgImage>

<Notes>

That brings us to the first contender, Enyzme
By AirBnB, an elderly 4 years old, can this reigning champion survive?
It's great at shallow testing, but watch out for refactoring!

Yeah is that how boxing, works? I dunno.

</Notes>

---

# Enzyme Shallow

```jsx
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
it("renders all todo items", () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<TodoList {...props} />);
  expect(wrapper.find("TodoItem")).toHaveLength(TODO_LIST.length);
});
```

<Notes>

Here's how you set up a shallow render in enzyme.
Import shallow, and render the component with some props
Then you have a wrapper that you can traverse and assert on
Check that it has one TodoItem for each list item.

Bad new there are two more of those boxing things to go

</Notes>

---

```jsx
it("show a todo item input?", () => {
  expect(
    wrapper
      .find("TodoItem")
      .first()
      .prop("todo")
  ).toEqual(TODO_LIST[0]);
});
```

<Notes>

Since we're not rendering the actual inputs, we can't check they they have the right data
All we can do is check that we're passing the right data to the right component.
Then can write another test that checks that, given some todo data, the TodoItem component show it in an input
So nice and isolated

</Notes>

---

# Shallow Downside: Refactoring

<Notes>

I like this approach
One big downside is refactoring - change to the code, but not what it does
a good react dev looks for opportunities to refactor a chunk of html into a component
Shallow makes that harder
look at an example:

</Notes>

---

```jsx
<div className="todo-list">
  Things to do:
  <TodoItem todo={todos[0]}>
  <TodoItem todo={todos[1]}>
  Done:
  <TodoItem todo={todos[2]}>
  <TodoItem todo={todos[3]}>
</div>
```

<Notes>

So here's how this looks now: there's some code that seperates out done todos and puts them under a header
But maybe we want to add a wrapper component, TodoWrapper, that gets a list of either to-do or done items, and renders them
with the right header.
That would look like:

</Notes>

---

# Refactored

```jsx
<div className="todo-list">
  <TodoWrapper done={false} todos={[todos[0], todos[1]]} />
  <TodoWrapper done={true} todos={[todos[2], todos[3]]} />
</div>
```

<Notes>

Seems like a good refactor, but now all the tests are broken, because TodoList isn't rendering TodoItems anymore
So even though from a user perspective the UX is exactly the same, we have to totally rewrite our tests
This might make you decide not to make the right refactor, which is a bummer

</Notes>

</div>

</BgImage>

<Notes>

Also supporting shallow rendering is our second contender, React Test Renderer.
By Facebook, only 6 months old, but lean and ready to fight.

Yeah. so React has always come with its own test utils. But this year they
added react-test-renderer, which renders a react component to JSON
They don't rely on a virtual dom, so support react native
particularly good for snapshot tests, but supports some other test types.

</Notes>

---

# react-test-render Shallow

```jsx
import { createRenderer } from "react-test-renderer/shallow";
const renderer = createRenderer();
renderer.render(<TodoList {...props} />);
const component = renderer.getRenderOutput();
```

<Notes>

also lets you shallow render, but you can't do much except snapshot the
result, which we'll see later.
So less interesting

</Notes>

---

# React Testing Library

<Img src={kentShallow} />

<Notes>

And finally RTL
I'm not going to do the voice yet because Kent isn't a fan of shallow testing, so it's not competing in this fight

</Notes>

---

# Mount / Full Render

<Notes>

Alternative is reneering the whole tree - a component, and all its children, down to the DOM
Called mount in enzyme, but you can think of it as a full instead of shallow render

</Notes>

---

```html
<div class="TodoList">
  <div>
    <h2>Todo List for:</h2>
    <input class="UsernameInput" />
  </div>
  <hr />
  <div class="TodoItem">
    <input placeholder="Enter a todo item" value="Learn Enzyme" />
    <button>Done</button>
    <button>X</button>
  </div>
  ...
</div>
```

<Notes>

Here's what the TodoList looks like from a mount test.
You can see the TodoList, Username input, and individual TodoItems, which are all components
But they're rendered down to divs and buttons, instead of components
So you can do things like trigger a click on a button that should effect a parent's state

</Notes>

<Notes>

Which brings us back to our third contender, RTL.
An independent fighter, it's a year and a half old, and the underdog faviorite. It's focused on advanced user-facing techniques, but it's not know for isolated testing.

Ok that's the last of those.

So this RTL is came out last year, and really quickly
got popular, felt like it came out of nowhere.
It's focused on getting you to write tests from a user perspective.

it's all about sloving that ItemWrapper test failure issue
But, it does make it harder to write isolated tests, as we'll see

</Notes>

---

"The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,  
the more confidence they can give you."  
-- Kent Dodds

<Notes>

RTL Guiding priciple

</Notes>

---

```jsx
import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
const result = render(<TodoList {...props} />);

const input = result.getByDisplayValue('Get Milk');
fireEvent.change(input, {
  target: { value: "New Title" }
});

expect(props.onTodoChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
...
```

<Notes>

In a RTL test, render, find the actual input that has the right value,
change it, and make sure that event gets dispatched correctly.

So we're actually working with input now, not just components.
But RTL has a lot of nice selector that let you query by value,
label, placeholder, or as a last resort a special data test id attribute.

So you write these tests that are more how a user or manual tester thinks

I find the input with the right value in it, change that input, it has an effect.

this test is resiliant to the TodoWrapper refactor that adds an extra layer of components in between the list

In the end it's still the same data in, DOM out tests as enzyme, but with a different twist.

There's a whole ecosystem around this libary that's cropped up - including Cypress integration - so if that user-centered testing appeals to you, then dig in.

You may be thinking, why did I waste my time learning about shallow?

But here's the problem...

</Notes>

---

# The test fails ðŸ˜ž

<Img src={mountFail} alt="Mount error message" />

<Notes>

This doesn't actually work. The error message says the problem is with UsernameInput, which is weird,
because this test doesn't have anything to do with that.

</Notes>

---

# Redux Troubles

```jsx
<TodoList>
  <Connected(UsernameInput) /> <-- the problem
  <TodoItem />
  <TodoItem />
```

<Notes>

If you've used redux before, you may already know what's going on here
I don't want to get too into redux here, but the upshot is the username input component is a
connect redux component, that will only work if there's a Provider in the component tree
So even though the redux thing is on a child, and we don't care about the child in this test,
we need to set up the test in a way that will make the component work.

</Notes>

---

# Setup without a connected child:

```jsx
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
const result = render(<TodoList {...props} />);
```

<Notes>

So you can only use this code to render a component if it doesn't happen to have a redux
child.

</Notes>

---

```jsx
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import configureMockStore from "redux-mock-store";
import thunk from "redux-thunk";
import defaultStore from "../redux/defaultStore";
const middleware = [thunk];
const mockStore = configureMockStore(middleware);

const result = render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <TodoList {...props} />
  </Provider>
);
```

<Notes>

If any child (or grandchild) is connected though, you have to do, uh, some setup

</Notes>

---

<BgImage
  src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eBCnpuRGBhQGY/giphy.gif"
  backgroundSize="cover"
/>

<Notes>

Not ideal. And the problem isn't just react - you never know what some child component will do, that's the point of unit testing.

I was once using a fancy text editor library. We wanted to test a simple change event, and we had to dig into the source code to figure out how to do that.

</Notes>

---

# Mocks to the rescue!

```jsx
jest.mock("../user/UsernameInput", () => () => (
  <div className="UsernameInput" />
));

const result = render(<TodoList {...props} />);
```

<Notes>

Of course there's a standard solution to dependencies, which
is mocking. We can mock out the child component with a
stub that's easier to work with, and go on with our lives.

This works, but then you have all the problems of mocks -
you have to know what to mock, and have to keep those mocks
up-to-date with the real implementation.

Still, for something between a shallow render (where everything is mocked) and a full render (where nothing is), this can be a good choice.

</Notes>

---

# Enzyme Mount

<Notes>

Enzyme, the older library, also supports full renders

</Notes>

---

```jsx
import { mount } from "enzyme";
it("changes todo items", () => {
  const wrapper = mount(<TodoList {...props} />);
  wrapper
    .find("input")
    .find({ value: "Get Milk" })
    .simulate("change", { target: { value: "New Title" } });

  expect(props.onTodoChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    ...TODO_LIST[0],
    title: "New Title"
  });
});
```

<Notes>

This the exact same test, with enzme mount instead of shallow.
Still finding the Get Milk todo item, and replacing it with a new title

But the test is a little less literate, a little more focused on
inputs and props.

If you're using enzyme already, I wouldn't switch to RTL for mount
tests. But if you're not, then RTL is a little nicer for this
kind of test.

</Notes>

---

# react-test-renderer

<Notes>

Finally react test renderer, takes the opposite approach of RTL, has an even lower-level api than enzyme.

</Notes>

---

```jsx
import renderer from "react-test-renderer";

it("changes todo items", () => {
  ...

  const input = component.findByProps({
    value: 'Get Milk'
  });
  input.props.onChange({ target: { value: "New Title" } });

  expect(props.onTodoChange).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  ...
```

<Notes>

Same test one more time.

A lot like enzyme, with targeting by css selector but fewer tools

A totally servicable library, and its nice that its by the react team,
so it'll always support the latest features.

Had a moment earlier this year when React launched new stuff, though since caught up

Enyzme and RTL are whole websites, API of RTR is one page

</Notes>

---

# Snapshot Testing

<Notes>

So far we've seen a few different ways to write standard tests.
Jest has a second method for writing tests that works with all these libraries
It's called snapshot testing, and it can be pretty handy in specific use cases

In a normal test, you come up with the specific things that should be true
In a snapshot test you take a snapshot of the state of the whole dom
Or any other JS object actually
This gets saved to a file, and then the next time you run the tests, it checks if that
output has changed at all. If it does, the test fails

</Notes>

---

<Img src={snapshotGood} />

<Notes>

Here's a failing snaphot, from an enzyme shallow test in this case.
I broke the conditional logic about only showing the inbox zero message when there's nothing to do.
The snapshot failed, and the diff shows the problem is this component wasn't in the snapshot last
time, but is now.

This is pretty sweet. I didn't have to write any specific test for this functionality - I just took a
snapshot, and it handled that test for me.

</Notes>

---

# Can I Stop Writing Tests Now?

<Notes>

So... does that mean you don't need real tests anymore? Just snapshot everything and call it a day?

</Notes>

---

<BgImage src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BiRHhbCpFK8k8/giphy.gif" />

<Notes>

Yeah, that doesn't go as well as you think it will

</Notes>

---

<Img src={snapshotBad} />

<Notes>

Unfortunatly snapshot failures often look like this. Can you see the problem?
Yeah, I just added a little div around some components, and everything goes red.
You can look closely and figure it out, but I've found that in practice, devs
get tired of that, and just re-record snapshots without looking at them.
Me included!
So I'd reccomend limiting the scope of snapshots, so you know that if one fails,
it might be real. Shallow is a good way to do that.

</Notes>

---

# Everybody's doing it

```jsx
// Enyzyme
expect(wrapper.debug()).toMatchSnapshot();
// React Testing Library
expect(result).toMatchSnapshot();
// react-test-renderer
expect(testRenderer.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
// react-test-renderer shallow
expect(testRenderer.getRenderOutput()).toMatchSnapshot();
```

<Notes>

If you want to use snapshots,
all these libraries have a way of outputting a JSON representation of the DOM,
which can be easily snapshotted. So whatever library you pick, you can use this.

But to keep snapshots small, one thing to do would be to use RTL for normal tests,
and RTR shallow for snapshots. YMMV.

</Notes>

---

# Wrapping Up: Combinations

<Notes>

So we've talked about a bunch of different tools and techniques.
How do you use them together?

</Notes>

---

# Combination 1

- Enzyme Shallow unit tests
- Enzyme Shallow Snapshots for components
- Enzyme Mount for multi-component components (like TodoList)
- Enzyme Mount Snapshots for page smoke tests
- Cypress for integration testing

<Notes>

What we did on last project

Mostly enzyme

Used mount for complicated interatctions that went across multiple components

Mount snapshot for each page. Breaks rule, but nice to smoke test everything and see what it will all look like
just expect this to break a lot

And cypress

</Notes>

---

# Combination 2

- React Testing Library component tests
- react-test-renderer shallow snapshot tests
- Cypress Testing Library Integration Tests

<Notes>

Don't add enzyme for shallow, too confusing

What i would probably try on next project, if team is willing

</Notes>

---

# It's all just

## props => elements

## events => callbacks

<Notes>

Remember, in the end, all these are really similar, even if they look
different.

Given props, what renders, and given events what's called.

What is the team familiar with, interested in,
will get to write tests and maintain them

</Notes>
